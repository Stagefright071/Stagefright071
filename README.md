Hi 👋 My name is Raghuram Subramani
===================================

Student and hacker
------------------

I started my journey by learning about android, rooting and custom ROMS with a Redmi Note 3 Pro (kenzo). Around ~2016 I started learning Linux (although I did not know it was Linux till later on) with a \`Raspberry Pi 3B+\`. It began with trying out things like wine and emulation. One of the things I wanted to do was running x86 programs on the RPI, which is ARM. This made me learn about CPU architectures. The whole RaspberryPi era helped me learn a lot about Linux, which in retrospect is really important. I started exploring hacking early on, in ~2017. I used Android tablets and phones, since I had no laptop/desktop, with termux and Custom ROMS on them. This helped me learn a lot about how Android APKs work and how Android works in general. Later on, in ~2020 I explored photo, video and audio editing. I also learned a little about 3D modeling, with Blender. Through it all, my curiosity kept me going.
